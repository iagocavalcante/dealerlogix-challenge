# Phone Spelling

### Functionality

- 1 - Build a simple interface in the browser where a user can enter a phone number. This can be a simple text box, or you can get fancy.
- 2 - As a number is typed, all of the English words that can be spelled with that number are displayed.
- 3 - There should be a way for the user to clear the phone number entered and start fresh (if a text box is used for the number, backspace will do).
- 4 - Bonus question: how could you structure data so that searching for the possible spelled words is highly efficient? You don't have to implement this, but feel free to describe it in your email back to us.
